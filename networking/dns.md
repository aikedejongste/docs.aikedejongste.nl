# DNS

## Links

- [DNSinspect](https://www.dnsinspect.com/)

## Check if the txt record has been processed

```bash
host -t txt _acme-challenge.example.com
```

## Show SOA records

```bash
host -t soa domain.com
```

## DNS on Debian Bookworm

Ubuntu differs from Debian!

```bash
apt install systemd-resolved
```

## DNS on Ubuntu using netplan

Maybe the better approach?

## DNS on Ubuntu using resolvconf

Don't use resolvconf on Debian.

Systemd priorizes on-link DNS server over global DNS server over global fallback DNS servers in its default settings.

```bash
apt install resolvconf
```

Make sure that /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf

```bash
ln -s /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Check CAA record

```bash
dig CAA yourdomain.com +noall +answer
```

## Verify DNSSEC

Check the DNSKEY record:

```bash
dig DNSKEY you.com +dnssec +noall +answer
```

And test an A record

```bash
dig A host1.you.com +dnssec +noall +answer
```

Or go to [DNSViz](https://dnsviz.net/) or [DNSSEC Analyzer](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/).
