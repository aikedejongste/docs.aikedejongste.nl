You can connect forms to user tasks in the modeler. If you click on the wrench of a user task,
a properties pane will show up on the right. Select "Camunda Form (linked)" for the form type.
And put the form id in the input box. For example "form_1".

## Deployment

Use the docker-compose.yaml that the project provides. Put Caddy in front of it
to access all the different services.
