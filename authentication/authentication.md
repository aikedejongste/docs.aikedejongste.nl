## Scopes

In the context of OIDC and OAuth 2.0, a scope is a mechanism that limits an
application's access to a user's account. Each scope represents a specific
permission granted by the user to the application.

## ID Tokens

* come from OIDC ## Access tokens
* give access to a resource
* come from OAuth2
