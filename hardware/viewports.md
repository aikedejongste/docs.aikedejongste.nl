# Viewports

The viewport is the effective number of pixels that your browser can use. This is not the
actual pixels the screen has. You can change the viewport on a screen by changing the
scaling. I'm measuring this by going [whatismyviewport.com](https://whatismyviewport.com/) with
the scaling at 100% or in MacOS set to 'maximum space'.

The reason I care about this is because this is a good indication of how much will
fit on the screen. Because with notches taking space away, all kinds of upscaling, interpolation,
retina marketing and unusual screen resolutions it is hard to tell. Feel free to add some more by
creating a pull request. Send me the pictures by email if you want me to host them. Don't put them
in the repository.
